# Multithreaded_WebCrawler
The advent of the internet has exponentially increased the amount of data available 
online. Efficient web crawling is essential for tasks such as indexing websites, ex-
tracting useful information, and ranking pages. This project aims to implement a 
multithreaded web crawler in the C programming language, leveraging multi-
threading to significantly reduce time consumption compared to single-threaded 
crawlers. The report explains the design, implementation, and challenges of devel-
oping a thread-safe web crawler that utilizes efficient data structures and synchro-
nization mechanisms.
